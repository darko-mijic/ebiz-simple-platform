# Enhanced Database Schema for EBIZ-Saas Platform

## Overview
This PR implements a comprehensive database schema redesign for the EBIZ-Saas platform, ensuring it fully supports all business requirements and frontend screens. The enhanced schema provides improved type safety, optimized performance through strategic indexing, and better data relationships to support the application's financial management features.

  - Implemented consistent naming conventions across the schema

- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Added strategic indexes on frequently queried fields
  - Optimized foreign key relationships with proper indexing
  - Added composite indexes for common filtering operations (date ranges, name searches)

- **Relationship Improvements**:
  - Enhanced Category model with proper Company relation
  - Added proper Transaction to Category relation
  - Implemented document versioning with self-referential relationships
  - Added vendor and customer relationships to transactions

### üìä Financial Data Management

  - Added metadata fields for better account management (`bankName`, `lastStatementDate`, `totalStatements`)
  - Implemented `BalanceHistory` model for tracking balance changes over time

- **Improved Transaction Model**:
  - Added category, vendor, and customer relationships
  - Enhanced status tracking with proper enum types
  - Added notes field for user annotations
  - Optimized indexing for common transaction queries (date, amount, type)

- **Document Management**:
  - Enhanced document model with proper status and type enums
  - Added versioning support for document revisions
  - Improved metadata for document processing status
  - Added parsing error tracking

### üîç Analytics & Reporting Support
- **Categorization System**:
  - Implemented proper Category model with type classification
  - Added support for both system-wide and company-specific categories
  - Enabled color coding for visual representation

- **Multi-Currency Support**:
  - Added CurrencyRate model for exchange rate tracking
  - Enhanced currency fields across financial models
  - Added support for currency conversion in reporting

### üîî User Experience Improvements
- **Alert System**:
  - Implemented Alert model with proper type enum
  - Added resolution status tracking
  - Enhanced relationship to relevant entities (accounts, documents)

- **User Settings**:
  - Added UserSettings model for user preferences
  - Implemented theme, language, and dashboard layout storage
  - Added notification preferences

- **Chat Interface Support**:
  - Added ChatMessage model for conversation history
  - Implemented structured response storage as JSON

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Architecture
The schema follows a clear domain-driven design with these key areas:

1. **User Management Domain**:
   - User authentication and profile data
   - Company management and user-company relationships
   - User preferences and settings

2. **Financial Management Domain**:
   - Bank accounts and statements
   - Transactions with comprehensive metadata
   - Balance history tracking

3. **Document Management Domain**:
   - Document storage and versioning
   - Parsing results and metadata
   - Transaction linking

4. **Business Intelligence Domain**:
   - Categorization system
   - Vendor and customer tracking
   - Currency conversion

5. **User Experience Domain**:
   - Alerts and notifications
   - Chat interface data
   - Dashboard preferences

### PostgreSQL Management
- Configured pgAdmin 4 in Docker for easy database management
- Updated connection settings in environment files
- Documented database access procedures

### Migration Strategy
- Implemented using Prisma's migration system
- Added proper indexes for performance optimization
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing data models

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the database containers:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Access pgAdmin at http://localhost:5050:
   - Login: admin@ebiz.com / admin_secure_pwd
   - Connect to the database using:
     - Host: postgres
     - Port: 5432
     - Username: ebizadmin
     - Password: ebiz_secure_pwd

3. Run Prisma migrations:
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name initial
```

4. Generate Prisma client:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

5. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

## Documentation Updates
- Updated Software Specification document with enhanced ERD
- Updated Software Architecture document with database details
- Ensured environment configuration files reflect the new setup
