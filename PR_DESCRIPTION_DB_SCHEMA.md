# Database Schema Enhancement PR

## Overview

This PR enhances the database schema to support all core business requirements of the EbizSimplePlatform. It introduces improved types, strategic indexes, and enhanced relationships between models, providing a solid foundation for building the application's features.

## Key Changes

### 1. User Management & Authentication
- Enhanced `User` and `UserCompany` models for multi-company support
- Added user settings with preferences for currency, language, and UI preferences

### 2. Financial Data Management
- Structured bank account system with statements and transactions
- Strategic indexes on date fields for performant financial queries
- Balance history tracking for reporting

### 3. Document Management
- Comprehensive document model with support for versioning
- Integration with MinIO for scalable document storage
- Document status tracking and type classification

### 4. Business Entity Management
- Vendor and Customer models with contact information
- Category system for transaction classification
- Tag system for flexible transaction organization

### 5. Advanced Features
- Support for recurring transactions and patterns
- Multi-language support via translation tables
- Activity logging for audit trail
- Alert system for notifications
- Enhanced document storage with MinIO integration

### 6. Technical Improvements
- Proper schema design with appropriate indexes
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive relationships between models
- Enum types for type safety

## Docker Configuration
- Added PostgreSQL and pgAdmin for database management
- Added MinIO for document storage (S3-compatible)

## Future Considerations
- Audit logging will be expanded to support event sourcing 
- Additional indexes may be added based on common query patterns
- Consider partitioning for large tables as data grows

## Testing
- Schema validated with Prisma
- Initial migration successful
- Core relations tested and working as expected

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Architecture
The schema follows a clear domain-driven design with these key areas:

1. **User Management Domain**:
   - User authentication and profile data
   - Company management and user-company relationships
   - User preferences and settings

2. **Financial Management Domain**:
   - Bank accounts and statements
   - Transactions with comprehensive metadata
   - Balance history tracking

3. **Document Management Domain**:
   - Document storage and versioning
   - Parsing results and metadata
   - Transaction linking

4. **Business Intelligence Domain**:
   - Categorization system
   - Vendor and customer tracking
   - Currency conversion

5. **User Experience Domain**:
   - Alerts and notifications
   - Chat interface data
   - Dashboard preferences

### PostgreSQL Management
- Configured pgAdmin 4 in Docker for easy database management
- Updated connection settings in environment files
- Documented database access procedures

### Migration Strategy
- Implemented using Prisma's migration system
- Added proper indexes for performance optimization
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing data models

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the database containers:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Access pgAdmin at http://localhost:5050:
   - Login: admin@ebiz.com / admin_secure_pwd
   - Connect to the database using:
     - Host: postgres
     - Port: 5432
     - Username: ebizadmin
     - Password: ebiz_secure_pwd

3. Run Prisma migrations:
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name initial
```

4. Generate Prisma client:
```bash
npx prisma generate
```

5. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

## Documentation Updates
- Updated Software Specification document with enhanced ERD
- Updated Software Architecture document with database details
- Ensured environment configuration files reflect the new setup

## Related Issues
- Closes #XX: Database schema needs to support all business requirements
- Addresses #XX: Improve database performance with proper indexing
- Supports #XX: Enable multi-currency support in the platform
