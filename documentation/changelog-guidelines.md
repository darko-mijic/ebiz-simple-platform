# Guidelines for Updating the CHANGELOG

This document outlines the rules and guidelines for maintaining the CHANGELOG.md file for the EBIZ-Saas Platform project.

## General Principles

1. **Newer entries on top**: Always add new entries at the top of the file, directly under the header section.
2. **Semantic versioning**: Use [Unreleased] for work that hasn't been deployed yet. Once released, replace with version number (e.g., [1.0.0]).
3. **Date format**: Include the date in YYYY-MM-DD format for each entry.
4. **Comprehensive**: Every significant change to the codebase should be documented in the changelog.

## Entry Categories

Organize changes under the following categories (in this order):

1. **Added**: New features or capabilities introduced.
2. **Changed**: Changes to existing functionality.
3. **Deprecated**: Features that will be removed in upcoming releases.
4. **Removed**: Features that have been removed.
5. **Fixed**: Bug fixes.
6. **Security**: Changes related to security vulnerabilities.

Only include categories that have applicable changes.

## Writing Style Guidelines

1. **Use present tense**: Write "Add feature" not "Added feature".
2. **Be concise but descriptive**: Aim for clarity while being brief.
3. **Use bullet points**: Each change should be a separate bullet point.
4. **Group related changes**: Use sub-bullets for related changes.
5. **Link to issues/PRs**: Include references to GitHub issues or PRs when applicable.

## Examples

Good entry:
```markdown
### Added
- User authentication with Google SSO (#123)
- Comprehensive suite of Gherkin feature files for end-to-end testing
  - Authentication flows
  - Transaction management
  - Document handling
```

Bad entry:
```markdown
### Changes
- Fixed bugs
- Added stuff
- Updated code
```

## Process

1. **Branch workflow**: Update the changelog as part of your feature branch before creating a PR.
2. **Review**: Changelog updates should be reviewed during PR review.
3. **Merge conflicts**: Resolve changelog merge conflicts by preserving all entries and reorganizing by date.
4. **Release preparation**: When preparing a release, update the [Unreleased] heading to the version number and create a new [Unreleased] section.

Following these guidelines helps maintain a consistent, useful record of project evolution and facilitates communication with users and team members.
