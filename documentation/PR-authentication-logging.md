# Pull Request: Authentication & Logging Improvements

## Overview

This pull request addresses authentication issues and implements a comprehensive logging infrastructure to improve the reliability, observability, and debuggability of the EBIZ-SaaS platform.

## Changes

### Authentication Enhancements

1. **JWT Strategy Improvements**
   - Implemented multi-source JWT token extraction (cookies & Authorization header)
   - Added detailed logging of token sources and validation steps
   - Fixed issues with cookie-based authentication

2. **Cookie Handling**
   - Added cookie-parser middleware to NestJS app
   - Ensured proper cookie configuration (httpOnly, sameSite, etc.)
   - Fixed CORS configuration to support credentials

3. **Logout Functionality**
   - Added a dedicated logout endpoint to properly clear authentication cookies
   - Implemented frontend logout function in AuthCheck component

### Logging Infrastructure

1. **Winston Logger Configuration**
   - Customized logging service with multiple log levels
   - Structured JSON logs with timestamps and metadata
   - Special methods for authentication event logging

2. **ELK Stack Integration**
   - Added Elasticsearch for centralized log storage
   - Configured Kibana for log visualization and searching
   - Created proper index mappings for timestamp fields

3. **Frontend Log Collection**
   - Added client-side logging functions
   - Implemented backend endpoint for collecting frontend logs
   - Ensured all authentication events are properly logged

### Documentation

1. **Logging Infrastructure Documentation**
   - Created detailed documentation on the logging system
   - Added usage instructions for Kibana
   - Documented authentication flow and debugging steps

2. **README Updates**
   - Updated main README with new infrastructure details
   - Added logging section to backend README
   - Included environment variable documentation

## Implementation Details

### Key Files Changed

1. **JWT Strategy**
   - `backend/src/auth/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts`
   - Added cookie extraction and detailed logging

2. **NestJS Main**
   - `backend/src/main.ts`
   - Added cookie-parser middleware and CORS config

3. **Auth Controller**
   - `backend/src/auth/auth.controller.ts`
   - Added logout endpoint and improved authentication flow

4. **Logger Service**
   - `backend/src/common/logger/logger.service.ts`
   - Implemented Winston logger with Elasticsearch integration

5. **Frontend AuthCheck**
   - `frontend/src/components/auth/AuthCheck.tsx`
   - Added logout function and improved error handling

### Docker Infrastructure

Added Elasticsearch and Kibana containers to docker-compose.yml for the ELK stack.

## How to Test

1. **Start the Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test Authentication Flow**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3001`
   - Log in with Google
   - Access protected routes
   - Log out

4. **View Logs in Kibana**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5601`
   - Create data view with pattern `ebiz-logs*` and `@timestamp` field
   - Go to Discover to view and search logs

## Screenshots

[Include screenshots of Kibana dashboard and successful authentication if available]

## Future Improvements

1. **Log Rotation**
   - Implement log rotation for file-based logs
   - Add automatic index lifecycle management in Elasticsearch

2. **Authentication Metrics**
   - Add login success/failure rate metrics
   - Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts

3. **Alert System**
   - Create alerts for authentication failures
   - Set up notifications for security events
