## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm (v8 or later)
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Setup

   ```
   Note: The Docker setup has been simplified to only include PostgreSQL configured for Prisma ORM.

4. Run the application:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000

## Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in the backend and frontend directories:

### Backend (.env)

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### Frontend (.env.local)
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Development Workflow

- **Start both applications**: `npm run dev`
- **Run end-to-end tests**: `npm run test:e2e`

## License

## Running the Application

To start the application:

1. **First, make sure to kill any processes using ports 3000 and 3001**:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Kill any processes using ports 3000 and 3001
npm run kill-ports

# Return to the root directory
cd ..
```

2. **Then start the application**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3001
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000

## shadcn/ui Components

This project uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for UI components. We've added:

- Button component
- Card component
- Input component
- Toast notifications

To see a demonstration of these components, visit the UI Test page at: http://localhost:3001/ui-test

### Adding More shadcn/ui Components

To add additional components:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Add a component using the CLI (example: adding a dialog)
npx shadcn-ui@latest add dialog
```

Remember to check the [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) for more details on available components. 


## Bash commands

### Share the Diff via Copy-Paste
Run this in your terminal:

git diff --staged > changes.diff && git diff >> changes.diff
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard | xargs -I {} git diff --no-index /dev/null {} >> changes.diff
cat changes.diff | pbcopy

What it does:
	1.	git diff --staged â†’ Adds staged changes.
	2.	git diff â†’ Adds unstaged changes.
	3.	git ls-files --others --exclude-standard â†’ Lists untracked files.
	4.	git diff --no-index /dev/null {} â†’ Appends content of untracked files.
	5.	pbcopy â†’ Copies the result to clipboard.

Now, just paste it wherever needed. ðŸš€

```bash
git diff --staged > changes.diff && git diff >> changes.diff
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard | xargs -I {} git diff --no-index /dev/null {} >> changes.diff
cat changes.diff | pbcopy
```

## Bash Script: Reset Git Working Directory

```bash
# Remove all untracked files and directories
git clean -df

# Restore all modified and deleted files to the last committed state
git restore .
```
What it does:
	â€¢	git clean -df â†’ Deletes all untracked files and directories.
	â€¢	git restore . â†’ Reverts all modified and deleted files to their last committed state.


## Bash One-Liner to Reset Git Working Directory

```bash
git clean -df && git restore .
```

What it does:
	â€¢	git clean -df â†’ Deletes all untracked files and directories.
	â€¢	git restore . â†’ Reverts all modified and deleted files to their last committed state.

This completely resets your working directory without affecting committed changes. ðŸš€
