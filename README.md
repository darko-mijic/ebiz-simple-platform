## shadcn/ui Components

This project uses [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for UI components. We've added:

- Button component
- Card component
- Input component
- Toast notifications

To see a demonstration of these components, visit the UI Test page at: http://localhost:3001/ui-test

### Adding More shadcn/ui Components

To add additional components:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Add a component using the CLI (example: adding a dialog)
npx shadcn-ui@latest add dialog
```

## Bash commands

### Share the Diff via Copy-Paste
Run this in your terminal:

git diff --staged > changes.diff && git diff >> changes.diff
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard | xargs -I {} git diff --no-index /dev/null {} >> changes.diff
cat changes.diff | pbcopy

What it does:
	1.	git diff --staged â†’ Adds staged changes.
	2.	git diff â†’ Adds unstaged changes.
	3.	git ls-files --others --exclude-standard â†’ Lists untracked files.
	4.	git diff --no-index /dev/null {} â†’ Appends content of untracked files.
	5.	pbcopy â†’ Copies the result to clipboard.

Now, just paste it wherever needed. ðŸš€

```bash
git diff --staged > changes.diff && git diff >> changes.diff
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard | xargs -I {} git diff --no-index /dev/null {} >> changes.diff
cat changes.diff | pbcopy
```

## Bash Script: Reset Git Working Directory

```bash
# Remove all untracked files and directories
git clean -df

# Restore all modified and deleted files to the last committed state
git restore .
```

## Bash One-Liner to Reset Git Working Directory

```bash
git clean -df && git restore .
```

This completely resets your working directory without affecting committed changes. ðŸš€

## Log Locations in the EBIZ-SaaS Platform

You're right, we still need to organize and clarify the logging system. Here's a breakdown of where all the logs are stored and how to access them:

## Backend Logs (NestJS)

### Current Location:
- **Console Output**: Currently, all backend logs are going to the console (terminal) where you ran `npm run dev:backend`
- These logs include detailed OAuth flow, database queries, authentication events, and JWT token generation

### Persistent Storage:
For production, we've configured Winston to write logs to files, but they're not active in development mode. To enable file logging:

1. Create a `logs` directory in the backend folder:
```bash
mkdir -p backend/logs
```

2. Edit the logger service to always use file logging by modifying `backend/src/common/logger/logger.service.ts`:
```typescript
// Remove the environment condition for file transports
transports: [
  new winston.transports.Console(),
  new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'logs/error.log', level: 'error' }),
  new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'logs/combined.log' }),
],
```

## Frontend Logs (Next.js)

### Current Location:
- **Browser Console**: All frontend logs are currently only sent to the browser's developer console
- You can see these logs by opening browser DevTools (F12 or right-click â†’ Inspect)

### Persistent Storage:
Frontend logs aren't automatically persisted. To store frontend logs, we need to:

1. Create a log API endpoint in the backend:
```typescript
// backend/src/common/logger/logger.controller.ts
@Controller('client-logs')
export class ClientLoggerController {
  constructor(private readonly logger: LoggerService) {}

  @Post()
  clientLog(@Body() logData: any) {
    this.logger.log(`[Client] ${logData.message}`, 'ClientLogger', logData.meta);
    return { received: true };
  }
}
```

2. Update the frontend logging functions to send logs to the backend:
```typescript
// Update logAuth and logAuthCheck functions to send logs to backend
const logAuth = async (action: string, details?: any) => {
  const logData = {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    action,
    ...details,
  };
  
  console.log(`[Auth] ${action}`, logData);
  
  // Send to backend
  try {
    const apiUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
    await fetch(`${apiUrl}/client-logs`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        message: action,
        meta: logData,
      }),
    });
  } catch (e) {
    // Silent fail for logging
    console.error('Failed to send log to server', e);
  }
};
```

## Combined Logs

For a complete view of both frontend and backend logs in one place, you have several options:

### Option 1: Log Aggregation
Use a tool like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) for log aggregation:

```bash
# Quick setup with Docker
docker run -d -p 5601:5601 -p 9200:9200 -p 5044:5044 -e "discovery.type=single-node" --name elk sebp/elk
```

### Option 2: Log Files
Store all logs (including the forwarded client logs) in the same backend log files. This is what we'll achieve by implementing the client-log API endpoint above.

### Option 3: Cloud Logging
For production, consider using a cloud logging service like:
- AWS CloudWatch
- Google Cloud Logging
- Azure Monitor
- Datadog
- New Relic

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Start by setting up the persistent file logging in the backend
2. Create the client-log API endpoint
3. Update frontend logging to send logs to backend
4. Add middleware to log HTTP requests and responses (for API debugging)

Would you like me to implement any of these specific improvements first?

## Testing Infrastructure

The platform implements two separate testing frameworks to ensure code quality and proper functionality:

### 1. Cypress Tests (Frontend Integration Tests)

Located in: `frontend/cypress/`

Cypress tests are used for frontend integration testing, focusing on component interactions and user flows.

#### Directory Structure:
- `e2e/` - Contains test specs for end-to-end testing
   - `auth.cy.js` - Authentication tests
   - `onboarding.cy.js` - Onboarding flow tests
   - `onboarding-completion.cy.js` - Tests for onboarding completion
- `fixtures/` - Contains mock data
   - `user.json` - Mock user data
   - `company.json` - Mock company data
- `support/` - Contains helper utilities
   - `commands.js` - Custom Cypress commands
   - `e2e.js` - E2E test configuration

#### Running Cypress Tests:
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Start the application in development mode (in a separate terminal)
npm run dev

# Open Cypress Test Runner
npm run cy:open

# Run tests headlessly
npm run cy:run
```

#### Key Features:
- Mock authentication with Google OAuth
- Test user onboarding flows
- Validate VAT ID verification
- Test form submissions

### 2. Playwright Tests (E2E Tests)

Located in: `e2e-tests/`

Playwright tests provide cross-browser testing capabilities and are used for comprehensive end-to-end testing.

#### Directory Structure:
- `tests/` - Contains test specs
   - `auth.spec.ts` - Authentication tests
   - `home.spec.ts` - Home page tests
- `fixtures/` - Contains test data
- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration

#### Running Playwright Tests:
```bash
# Run from project root with frontend running
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific tests
npx playwright test tests/auth.spec.ts
```

#### Key Features:
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit)
- API mocking and interception
- Visual regression testing capability
- Authentication flow testing

## Structured Logging

The platform implements structured logging for improved debugging and monitoring capabilities.

### Backend Logging

Located in: `backend/src/utils/logger.js`

The backend uses Winston for structured JSON logging with the following severity levels:
- ERROR: For errors that require immediate attention
- WARN: For potentially harmful situations
- INFO: For general operational information
- DEBUG: For detailed debugging information (development only)

#### Usage:
```javascript
const logger = require('../utils/logger');

// Log information with context
logger.info('User registered', { userId: user.id, email: user.email });

// Log errors with stack traces
try {
  // operation
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to process payment', { 
    error: error.message,
    orderId: order.id,
    stack: error.stack
  });
}
```

### Frontend Logging

Located in: `frontend/src/utils/logger.ts`

The frontend uses a custom logging utility that:
- Formats logs consistently
- Only sends critical errors to the backend
- Includes user context when available

#### Usage:
```typescript
import { logger } from '../utils/logger';

// Log user actions
logger.info('User completed onboarding', { step: 'company' });

// Log errors
try {
  // operation
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Form submission failed', { formId: 'onboarding', error: error.message });
}
```

## Maintenance and Best Practices

1. **Keep Tests Independent**: Each test should be able to run independently without depending on other tests.
2. **Update Tests With UI Changes**: When changing the UI, update corresponding tests.
3. **Use Descriptive Test Names**: Tests should clearly describe what they're testing.
4. **Don't Test Implementation Details**: Focus on testing behavior, not implementation.
5. **Review Test Results Regularly**: Monitor failing tests and fix them promptly.

## Current Test Status and Next Steps

### Current Status

The test infrastructure is set up and configured, but some tests are currently skipped due to:

1. **Application Structure Changes**: The tests were created based on a specific application structure, but the actual implementation differs in selectors, routes, and API endpoints.

2. **Authentication Mocking**: The Google OAuth authentication mocking needs to be adjusted to match the actual authentication flow.

3. **Running Environment**: Tests require both the frontend and backend servers to be running on the expected ports.

### Next Steps

1. **Update Selectors and Routes**: Adjust the tests to use the correct selectors and routes based on the current application structure.

2. **Fix Authentication Mocking**: Ensure the authentication mocking correctly simulates the Google OAuth flow for both Cypress and Playwright tests.

3. **Add More Basic Tests**: Start with simple tests that verify basic functionality before implementing more complex scenarios.

### How to Run Tests Now

Currently, most tests are skipped to avoid failures. To run the available tests:

```bash
# For Cypress tests (with frontend running)
cd frontend
npm run cy:open
# Select "E2E Testing" and pick one of the available test files

# For Playwright tests (with frontend running)
npm run test:e2e
```

## Authentication

The platform uses Google OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication, providing users with a streamlined sign-in experience.

### Setting Up Authentication

1. Create a Google OAuth 2.0 client in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Configure the OAuth consent screen
3. Create OAuth client credentials
4. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - Development: `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback`
   - Production: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/google/callback`

### Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env` files with the following variables:

```
# Backend .env
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRATION=3600s
```

### Authentication Flow

1. User initiates login by clicking "Sign in with Google"
2. Google OAuth consent screen is displayed
3. After consent, user is redirected back to the application
4. JWT token is issued for API authentication
5. Protected routes require valid JWT token

For detailed implementation information, see [AUTHENTICATION.md](./docs/AUTHENTICATION.md).

## Structured Logging

The platform implements a comprehensive structured logging system to facilitate debugging, monitoring, and analysis.

### Log Levels

- **ERROR**: Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- **WARN**: Potential problems that don't prevent operation
- **INFO**: Significant events and milestones
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for troubleshooting
- **VERBOSE**: Extremely detailed diagnostic information

### Log Storage

- Development: Local files in `backend/logs/`
  - `combined.log`: All logs
  - `error.log`: Error logs only
- Production: Elasticsearch (configurable)

### Using Logs

Access development logs:

```bash
# View all logs
cat backend/logs/combined.log

# View only errors
cat backend/logs/error.log

# Tail logs in real-time
tail -f backend/logs/combined.log
```

For detailed logging information, see [LOGGING.md](./docs/LOGGING.md).

## Testing

The platform includes multiple testing layers to ensure functionality and reliability.

### Testing Frameworks

- **Cypress**: Frontend integration testing
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing
- **Jest**: Unit testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run frontend integration tests with Cypress
cd frontend
npm run cy:open  # Interactive mode
npm run cy:run   # Headless mode

# Run end-to-end tests with Playwright
npm run test:e2e

# Run unit tests
