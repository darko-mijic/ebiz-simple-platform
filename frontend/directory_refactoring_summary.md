# Frontend Directory Structure Refactoring Summary

## Problem

The frontend codebase had a problematic directory structure with multiple nested "frontend" directories:
- `./frontend`
- `./frontend/frontend`
- `./frontend/frontend/frontend`

This caused several issues:
1. Confusion about where the actual application code lived
2. Duplicate public assets (icons, favicon, etc.) in each nested directory
3. Path resolution problems in the application
4. Maintenance difficulties with duplicated files
5. Build errors related to icon references

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive refactoring plan to clean up the directory structure:

1. **Created a backup** of the entire codebase to ensure we could revert if needed
2. **Analyzed the directory structure** to identify:
   - The main project was in the root `frontend` directory
   - Nested directories only contained duplicate public assets
   - No actual code in nested directories, only empty API directory
3. **Removed nested directories** to eliminate duplication
4. **Simplified icon references** in the codebase:
   - Updated `layout.tsx` to use absolute paths
   - Removed `assetPrefix` from `next.config.js`
5. **Fixed type errors** that were preventing successful builds:
   - Updated toast component to handle type/variant mapping
   - Fixed type mismatches in multiple files
6. **Successfully built the application** to verify our changes

## Benefits

The refactoring resulted in several improvements:

1. **Cleaner directory structure** following Next.js conventions
2. **Simplified asset management** with all assets in a single public directory
3. **Improved build process** with no errors related to directory structure
4. **Better maintainability** with a standard project layout
5. **Reduced confusion** for developers working on the codebase

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified
- `layout.tsx`: Updated icon references to use absolute paths
- `next.config.js`: Removed assetPrefix configuration
- `toaster.tsx`: Fixed type mapping between toast types and variants
- Multiple files: Fixed toast type errors

### Directory Structure Before
```
frontend/
├── frontend/
│   ├── frontend/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   └── public/
│   ├── public/
│   └── src/
├── public/
└── src/
```

### Directory Structure After
```
frontend/
├── public/
│   ├── icon/
│   │   ├── dark/
│   │   └── light/
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   └── apple-icon.png
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   ├── components/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Conclusion

The directory structure refactoring has successfully simplified the codebase, making it more maintainable and easier to work with. The application now builds without errors and follows standard Next.js conventions.
