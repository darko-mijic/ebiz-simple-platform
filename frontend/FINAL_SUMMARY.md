# Final Summary of Changes

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to the EBIZ-Saas Platform frontend application during our development and refactoring process. The project has evolved into a comprehensive Next.js 14 application with improved architecture, enhanced UI components, and better maintainability.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Directory Structure Refactoring
- **Problem**: The project had excessive nesting of "frontend" directories (`frontend/frontend/frontend`) causing confusion and path resolution issues.
- **Solution**:
