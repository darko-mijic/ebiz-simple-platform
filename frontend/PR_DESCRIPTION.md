# Build Complete Next.js Frontend with Modern UI and Improved Architecture

## Overview
This PR introduces a fully functional frontend application built with Next.js 14, featuring a modern UI, proper component architecture, comprehensive tooling integration, and a standardized directory structure. The implementation follows best practices for Next.js App Router and client/server component separation.

## Key Changes

### üèóÔ∏è Complete Frontend Architecture
- Implemented Next.js 14 App Router architecture with proper route organization:
  - Protected routes structure in `(protected)` folder
  - Authentication routes in `(auth)` folder
  - Correct routing and redirects
- Fixed critical component architecture issues:
  - Resolved metadata export errors in client components
  - Implemented wrapper pattern for client components in server contexts
  - Added proper "use client" directives where needed
- Standardized directory structure:
  - Cleaned up nested frontend directories for better organization
  - Simplified asset referencing and improved build process
  - Fixed type errors related to toast notifications
  - Improved overall maintainability with a clean structure

### üé® Modern UI Implementation
- Integrated shadcn/ui component library with Tailwind CSS for consistent design
- Built complete dashboard layout with:
  - Responsive sidebar navigation with collapsible functionality
  - Header with theme toggle and user notifications
  - Content area with proper overflow handling
- Created mock data interfaces for realistic UI presentation
- Implemented comprehensive page templates for all main sections:
  - Dashboard with financial overview and interactive charts
  - Bank accounts management
  - Transactions list and filtering
  - Documents management
  - Settings page
  - Authentication screens
  - Multi-step onboarding flow with form validation

### üåì Theme System Implementation
- Integrated Next.js theme provider (`next-themes`)
- Added theme toggle functionality in the header
- Applied Tailwind's dark mode classes throughout the UI
- Fixed hydration issues with proper suppressHydrationWarning

### üìä Data Visualization & Interaction
- Integrated Recharts for data visualization components
- Created interactive chart components for financial data:
  - Account distribution pie chart with custom styling
  - Account trend area chart with proper axes and grid
  - Enhanced tooltips for better data readability
  - Improved chart styling with gradients and proper colors
  - Increased chart heights for better visualization
- Implemented toast notification system for user feedback
- Added form handling with react-hook-form and zod validation:
  - Comprehensive validation rules for all form fields
  - Real-time error feedback for users
  - Simulated API interactions (e.g., VAT ID validation)

### üìÅ Dashboard Component Improvements
- Extracted monolithic dashboard into focused, single-responsibility components:
  - AccountSummary: Shows balance overview with interactive charts
  - RecentTransactions: Displays latest financial transactions
  - RecentDocuments: Shows recently uploaded documents with status
  - Alerts: Presents system alerts requiring user attention
- Created proper TypeScript interfaces for all data models
- Organized mock data into dedicated files for better maintainability
- Removed manual refresh in favor of automatic updates
- Enhanced chart visualizations with proper formatting and styling

### üìù Documentation
- Created comprehensive README with:
  - Complete tooling documentation
  - Component architecture guidelines
  - Usage instructions for all integrated libraries
  - Examples and best practices
  - Directory structure information
  - Troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Added PR description detailing all significant changes
- Provided inline code documentation for complex logic

## Technical Details

### Component Architecture Pattern
The project implements a clean separation between server and client components:

- **Server Components**:
  - Used for layouts, static content, and data fetching
  - SEO-friendly with proper metadata
  - No client-side JavaScript bundle impact
  
- **Client Components**:
  - Used for interactive UI elements requiring state
  - Clearly marked with "use client" directive
  - Properly isolated in the component tree
  
- **Wrapper Pattern**:
  - SidebarWrapper and HeaderWrapper components encapsulate client functionality
  - Enables clean integration in server component layouts
  - Prevents "use client" directive conflicts with metadata exports

### Directory Structure Improvements
- Removed nested frontend directories for a cleaner structure
- Standardized asset locations in the public directory
- Improved icon handling for better browser extension compatibility
- Fixed type errors and build issues for smoother deployment
- Enhanced maintainability with a logical file organization

### UI Component System
- shadcn/ui components provide consistent, accessible UI elements
- Tailwind CSS for styling with dark mode support
- Custom components built on top of this foundation for app-specific needs

### Data Handling and Visualization
- Recharts for data visualization with custom styling and tooltips
- SWR for data fetching with caching and revalidation
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Form handling with react-hook-form and zod validation

### Onboarding Flow
- Multi-step form with proper state management
- Form validation using zod schema
- User and company information collection
- VAT ID validation with error handling

## How to Test

1. Start the development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

2. Explore the application routes:
   - Home dashboard: http://localhost:3001/
   - Settings page: http://localhost:3001/settings
   - Auth page: http://localhost:3001/auth
   - Onboarding flow: http://localhost:3001/onboarding
   - Bank accounts: http://localhost:3001/bank-accounts
   - Additional protected routes as documented in README

3. Test theme functionality:
   - Toggle between light/dark mode using the button in the header
   - Verify that all UI components properly reflect the theme change

4. Verify error handling:
   - Test authenticated routes behavior
   - Verify proper redirect from /login to /auth
   - Confirm toast notifications work for user feedback
   - Test form validation in the onboarding flow

5. Check browser extension compatibility:
   - Verify icon loading in browser extensions
   - Test with the extension-manifest.json if needed
   - Verify the custom icon directory structure works as expected
