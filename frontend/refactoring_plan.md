# Frontend Directory Structure Refactoring Plan

## Current Issues (Resolved)
- Multiple nested "frontend" directories: `./frontend`, `./frontend/frontend`, and `./frontend/frontend/frontend`
- Duplicate public assets (icons, favicon, etc.) in each nested directory
- Potential path resolution issues due to nested structure
- Maintenance difficulties with duplicated files

## Refactoring Steps (Completed)

### 1. Backup (Completed)
- Created backup at `~/frontend_backup`

### 2. Analysis (Completed)
- Identified main project in root `frontend` directory
- Nested directories only contain duplicate public assets
- No actual code in nested directories, only empty API directory

### 3. Clean Up Nested Directories (Completed)
```bash
# Remove nested frontend directories
rm -rf frontend/frontend
```

### 4. Verify Structure (Completed)
```bash
# Verify public directory has all necessary assets
ls -la public
ls -la public/icon
```

### 5. Update Icon References (Completed)
- Updated `layout.tsx` to use simpler icon references
- Updated `next.config.js` to remove assetPrefix

### 6. Fix Type Errors (Completed)
- Fixed toast type errors in multiple files
- Updated toaster component to map between type and variant

### 7. Rebuild Application (Completed)
```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build
```

## Final Outcome
- Clean, standard Next.js directory structure
- No nested duplicate directories
- All assets properly organized in the public directory
- Application builds without errors
- Icon references simplified
- Type errors fixed
