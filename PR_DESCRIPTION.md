## Technical Details

### Component Architecture Pattern
The project implements a clean separation between server and client components:

- **Server Components**:
  - Used for layouts, static content, and data fetching
  - SEO-friendly with proper metadata
  - No client-side JavaScript bundle impact
  
- **Client Components**:
  - Used for interactive UI elements requiring state
  - Clearly marked with "use client" directive
  - Properly isolated in the component tree
  
- **Wrapper Pattern**:
  - SidebarWrapper and HeaderWrapper components encapsulate client functionality
  - Enables clean integration in server component layouts
  - Prevents "use client" directive conflicts with metadata exports

### UI Component System
- shadcn/ui components provide consistent, accessible UI elements
- Tailwind CSS for styling with dark mode support
- Custom components built on top of this foundation for app-specific needs

### Data Handling and Visualization
- Recharts for data visualization
- SWR for data fetching with caching and revalidation
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Form handling with react-hook-form and zod validation

### Authentication Flow
- Google OAuth integration
- Protected route handling
- Login redirect configuration

### üî• Enhanced Dashboard Implementation
- **Comprehensive Financial Overview**:
  - Total balance display with percentage change indicators
  - Multi-account view with individual balance trends
  - Account distribution visualization with interactive pie chart
  - Balance history trends with custom tooltips

- **Actionable Alerts System**:
  - Intelligent alerts for documents needing attention
  - Missing bank statement notifications
  - Direct action buttons from alert notices

- **Transaction Management**:
  - Recent transactions table with smart formatting
  - Transaction categorization and filtering
  - Clear empty states for new users

- **Document Processing**:
  - "Documents Needing Attention" section with priority highlighting
  - Recent documents list with status indicators
  - Quick upload actions from dashboard

- **Real-time Refresh Capabilities**:
  - Manual refresh with loading states
  - Automatic refresh at configurable intervals
  - Section-specific error handling and retry functionality

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Optimized layouts for mobile, tablet and desktop
  - Grid-based organization for efficient space usage
  - Consistent spacing and visual hierarchy

- **Error Handling & Recovery**:
  - Granular error states for individual dashboard sections
  - Targeted retry functionality for failed data loads
  - Helpful empty states with clear actions

## How to Test

1. Start the development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

2. Explore the application routes:
   - Home dashboard: http://localhost:3001/
   - Settings page: http://localhost:3001/settings
   - Auth page: http://localhost:3001/auth
   - Bank accounts: http://localhost:3001/bank-accounts
   - Additional protected routes as documented in README

3. Test theme functionality:
   - Toggle between light/dark mode using the button in the header
   - Verify that all UI components properly reflect the theme change

4. Verify error handling:
   - Test authenticated routes behavior
   - Verify proper redirect from /login to /auth
   - Confirm toast notifications work for user feedback

5. Test dashboard functionality:
   - Click the refresh button to see loading states
   - Test empty states by toggling the state (development only)
   - Verify all charts and visualizations are interactive
   - Confirm responsive layout works on different screen sizes

# Google Authentication, Structured Logging and Test Infrastructure

## Overview
This PR introduces Google OAuth authentication, comprehensive structured logging, and establishes test infrastructure for the EBIZ Simple Platform. It provides the foundation for secure authentication flows, monitoring capabilities, and automated testing to ensure code quality.

## Key Changes

### üîê Google OAuth Authentication
- Implemented complete Google OAuth authentication flow
- Added JWT token-based authentication for API endpoints
- Created secure user creation and linking during OAuth login
- Added protection for routes with JWT auth guards
- Implemented proper error handling for authentication edge cases

### üìä Structured Logging System
- Implemented Winston logger with multiple transport options:
  - Console output for development
  - Combined and error-specific file logging
  - Elasticsearch integration for production (configured but disabled)
- Created domain-specific logging methods for authentication, users, etc.
- Added structured JSON format with consistent fields and metadata
- Implemented context-aware logging throughout the application
- Support for correlation IDs to track requests across services

### üß™ Test Infrastructure
- Set up Cypress for frontend integration testing
- Implemented Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Created test utilities and fixtures
- Added test configurations for different environments
- Set up mock data and authentication flows for testing

### üß© Additional Improvements
- Added modules for onboarding, VAT validation, and custom validators
- Enhanced error handling with structured error responses
- Added comprehensive documentation for authentication, logging, and testing
- Improved project structure with dedicated directories for tests
- Updated README with detailed sections on authentication, logging, and testing

## Technical Details

### Authentication Architecture
The authentication system follows these key principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - `AuthService` for core authentication logic
   - `GoogleStrategy` for OAuth provider integration
   - `JwtStrategy` for token validation
   - `JwtAuthGuard` for protecting routes

2. **User Management**:
   - Automatic user creation for new OAuth logins
   - Profile information synchronization
   - Secure JWT token generation and validation

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Token expiration and refresh mechanisms
   - Proper error handling for failed authentication
   - Secure storage of OAuth credentials
   - Protection against common authentication attacks

### Logging Architecture
The logging system is designed with these features:

1. **Structured Format**:
   - JSON-based logs for machine readability
   - Consistent field naming and structure
   - Contextual metadata for every log entry

2. **Multiple Transport Options**:
   - Console transport with color coding for development
   - File transport with rotation for persistent storage
   - Elasticsearch transport (configurable for production)

3. **Log Levels and Categorization**:
   - ERROR: Critical issues requiring immediate attention
   - WARN: Potential problems that don't prevent operation
   - INFO: Significant events and milestones
   - DEBUG: Detailed information for troubleshooting
   - VERBOSE: Extremely detailed diagnostic information

### Test Infrastructure
The test infrastructure consists of:

1. **Frontend Testing (Cypress)**:
   - Component testing for React components
   - Integration testing for user flows
   - Custom commands for authentication and common actions

2. **End-to-End Testing (Playwright)**:
   - Cross-browser testing capabilities
   - Visual regression testing
   - API mocking for consistent test environments

3. **Test Utilities**:
   - Mock data generators
   - Authentication helpers
   - Custom assertions

## How to Test

1. **Authentication Testing**:
```bash
# Start the backend
cd backend
npm run start:dev

# Start the frontend 
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Test Google OAuth flow by visiting:
http://localhost:3001/auth/login
```

2. **View Logs**:
```bash
# Check combined logs
cat backend/logs/combined.log

# Check error logs
cat backend/logs/error.log
```

3. **Run Tests**:
```bash
# Run Cypress tests
cd frontend
npm run cy:run

# Run Playwright tests
npm run test:e2e
```
